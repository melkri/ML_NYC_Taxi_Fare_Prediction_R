# ML_NYC_Taxi_Fare_Prediction_R

Welcome to our project "ML - NYC Taxi Fare Prediction", where several ML methods are applied to classify bank clients. The project is part of the "Machine Learning 2" course.

# Data source
We base on the dataset delivered by our lecturer. The dataset contains additional 10 "mysterious" variables (feat01 - feat10) generated by him. While the exact details of how these variables were generated are not provided, they may contain additional features or information that could be relevant for analysis.

# Further Description of the project You can find in the ML_NYC_Taxi_Fare_Prediction_R.Rproj and ML_NYC_Taxi_Fare_Prediction_R.html
Enjoy ;)
